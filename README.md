# deep-learning
Deep learning self-projects which I got inspired from my studies in the Deep Learning nanodegree (reference [1]). In this implementation the nanodegree projects are being expanded further, for experimentation and better understanding of the the Deep Learning concepts.

## Projects
* **Project ANN**: In this project, a neural network is built from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on the Bike Sharing Dataset (reference [2]). By building a neural network from the ground up, we can have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher level tools such as PyTorch. The project together with its README file is hosted under the [project_ann](https://github.com/vsaveris/deep-learning/tree/master/project_ann) directory of the repository.
* **Project CNN**: In this project, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) pipeline is built (from scracth and with transfer learning). Given an image of a dog, the model will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. In this project PyTorch, an open source machine learning framework that accelerates the path from research prototyping to production deployment, is used. The project together with its README file is hosted under the [project_cnn](https://github.com/vsaveris/deep-learning/tree/master/project_cnn) directory of the repository.

## Future Projects (to be added in the repository)
* **Project RNN**: In this project, we generate our own Seinfeld TV scripts using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). We use a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network we build generates a new, "fake" TV script.
* **Project GAN**: In this project, we use Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for generating new images of faces.
* **Project AWS Sage Maker**: In this project we construct a Recurrent Neural Network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. We create this model using Amazon's SageMaker service. In addition, we deploy our model and construct a simple web app which will interact with the deployed model.
